Our client is the CFO of Proud Smart technologies, an incredibly successful internet of things company based out of China. Proud Smart is planning on creating an internal education platform in the very near future. Our team was tasked with creating the proof of concept for this web app, this is to demonstrate to the company that the concept is possible. As such the aesthetic appeal of the site was secondary to the core functionality of the site. That is to say, there are three user types; admin, educator and user. The Admins main function is to approve and edit courses as well as approve applications to become a teacher. The educators main function is to create new courses. The users main function is to buy and use the courses.
The tech stack used for the app was MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs and NodeJs. Peripheral and third party services include AWS, Heroku, GitHub, Git, Trello.

### Deployment and available scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

##Design Porcess:

The design process included drawing inspiration from other learning platforms such as coursera and udemy. Thereafter wireframes were constructed as seen in the images below, alongside the pages from which they were inspired. A screenshot was processed through Canvas colour palette generator and implemented into the build.
